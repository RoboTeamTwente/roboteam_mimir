Name
In Norse mythology the tree Yggdrasil makes up the entire world. At the root of the tree Yggdrasil there is a well. The water from this well contains all the knowledge and wisdom in the world, and feeds Yggdrasil. A mythical creature called Mímir guards the well, and drinks from it every day. Odin famously sacrificed an eye in order to be able to drink from Mímir's well. As Mímir is not a god, he is mortal; he is beheaded in a war. After his death, Odin carries around Mímir's head and asks it for secret knowledge and advice.
